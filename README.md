# Filter-Bubble

This repository contains the website for the _JEDS Filter Bubble_ project.

## Background

Online and mobile news consumption leaves digital traces that are used to personalize news supply, possibly creating filter bubbles where people are exposed to a low diversity of issues and perspectives that match their preferences. The [JEDS Filter Bubble](http://ccs.amsterdam/projects/jeds/) project aims to understand the filter bubble effect by performing deep semantic analyses on mobile news consumption traces. This project is a collaboration between the [VU](https://www.vu.nl/nl/index.aspx), the [UvA](http://www.uva.nl/) and [NLeSC](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/), lead by [Wouter van Atteveldt](http://vanatteveldt.com/).
