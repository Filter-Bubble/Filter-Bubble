  <p><strong><span>Welcome!</span></strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You are invited to participate in a research conducted by the University of Amsterdam. I am Damian Trilling of the ASCoR and I ask your help in our research project on exposure to political news online.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong><span>How will the research look like exactly?</span></strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>With this research we want to understand how people encounter news and political information online. This short study consists of two parts: Installing a software extension on your computer and filling out a survey.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We ask you to install a software extension called WebHistorian on your computer.  This extension will be used to understand how people encounter news online, we also ask you send us data about the URLs you visit on the internet. We call this your web browsing history. Web browsing history data includes the URLs you have visited, the title of the web pages visited, and the time they were visited. You will have the opportunity to review this data before submitting it and to delete whatever URLs you do not want to share.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This extension reads your browser history and allows you to explore and visualize your browsing history. It also allows you to upload this data to our server, which is what we ask you to do. No data will be uploaded without you actively doing so. Web Historian also collects data about how long the data review process took (e.g. 5 minutes) and how much browsing data was deleted (e.g. 5%).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The second part of the study will take place two weeks after you have installed the extension. Then you are asked to again submit the data that the extension collects to our server and additionally fill out a short survey about your experiences with the extension. This survey should take no more than 15 minutes of your time. You will be contacted by us when you have to take the second part of the survey.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong><span>Privacy</span></strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The University of Amsterdam collects and uses personal data for scientific purposes only, and in accordance with the national and European law.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To store the data safely, we store the collected information on secured university servers at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On top of the secure infrastructure, we will use encryption technology every time data are stored or transferred. The data will be kept up to five years once the research is published and then be destroyed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To protect your privacy, your name or contact information will not be stored together with the survey or browsing history data. Also, your responses will be confidential. We will only link your contact information once to your profile to recontact you for the second wave, afterwards every link between the datasets will be deleted. We will not share any information that could identify you with any third party. To help protect your confidentiality, the stored information will not contain information that will identify you, and all the data will be analyzed collectively.</p>
  <p>We do not share the original raw research data with anyone. Other scientists, in some cases, can only obtain anonymous data from us after an ethical review of their own university.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When we publish research results, we always ensure that these results cannot be deduced to individual individuals.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong><span>Your rights</span></strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Your participation in this research study is voluntary. You can decide to stop the investigation at any time without giving us any reasons for your decision and without any negative consequences. If you decide not to participate in this study or if you withdraw from participating at any time, you will not be penalized. Furthermore, you have up to 7 days after the last survey to withdraw your permission for the use of your data in the research. None of these actions will at any time entail adverse consequences for you. We will no longer use the data if you decide to stop the study.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If you want to visit a website that is part of our list and do not want the program to register, you can always turn off the program temporarily.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You can contact us if you have any questions or want more information by  sending an email to the responsible researcher, Damian Trilling (d.c.trilling@uva.nl).</p>
